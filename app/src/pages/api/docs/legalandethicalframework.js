In situations where tax law lacks clarity or is open to multiple interpretations, Abrahamic undertakes a comprehensive and meticulous tax assessment process. This process will be designed to guide our approach, adopting a reasonable and legally sound interpretative stance. To reinforce this approach, we may seek the expertise of external advisors to provide additional insights and ensure that the position taken aligns with the principles of legality.</p>

        <p>The Abrahamic approach to managing tax uncertainty is grounded in the principles of legality, clarity, and proactive engagement with tax authorities.
