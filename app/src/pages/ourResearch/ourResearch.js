                    <br />
                    Biodegradable products are products that can be broken down by natural processes into their constituent parts, such as carbon dioxide, water, and biomass, without causing harm to the environment. Biodegradation is a process by which natural microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, break down organic materials into simpler compounds. When biodegradable products are composted, they decompose into organic matter, which can be used to enrich soil and promote plant growth. This process does not produce the same greenhouse gas emissions that burning or landfilling can produce.
                    
                    <br /> <br />
                    Composting is a sustainable way of dealing with organic waste, and it can significantly reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. In addition, the compost produced from biodegradable products can be used as a natural fertilizer, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers, which are often made from fossil fuels.
                    <br /> <br />
                    It's important to note that not all biodegradable products can be composted, and not all compostable products are biodegradable. Some biodegradable products require specific conditions to break down, such as a certain temperature or level of moisture, while others may break down into harmful chemicals or microplastics. Therefore, it's important to carefully consider the materials and processes used to make and dispose of biodegradable products to ensure that they are truly sustainable and environmentally friendly.
                    <br /> <br />
                    In some cases, biodegradable products can be cheaper than plastics, especially if they are made from renewable resources that are abundant and cost-effective to produce. However, the cost of biodegradable products can vary depending on several factors, including the materials used, the manufacturing process, and the demand for the product.
                    <br /> <br />
                    In general, biodegradable products that are made from renewable resources, such as plant-based materials, may be more cost-effective over the long term because they are less dependent on non-renewable resources and may be easier to dispose of in an environmentally friendly way. In addition, the cost of plastic production may increase due to increasing regulations and taxes on carbon emissions.
                    <br /> <br />
                    However, it's important to note that the cost of biodegradable products can still be higher than traditional plastics in some cases, especially if the manufacturing process is more complex or if the demand for the product is low. As with any product, the cost of biodegradable products will depend on a variety of factors, including the materials, production process, and market demand.

                <p style={styles.subtitle}>Biodegradable products and zero emission:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduced waste in landfills: Biodegradable products are designed to break down quickly and naturally, which means they won't contribute to the accumulation of waste in landfills. Landfills are a significant source of methane emissions, which is a potent greenhouse gas.</li> <br />
                        <li>Reduced energy consumption in production: Biodegradable products often require less energy to produce compared to traditional products. This is because they are made from renewable resources, such as plant-based materials, which require less energy to grow, and process compared to fossil fuels.</li> <br />
                        <li>Reduced emissions during disposal: When biodegradable products are disposed of in the environment, they break down naturally without releasing harmful chemicals or greenhouse gases. Traditional products, on the other hand, can release toxins and pollutants into the air and water when they decompose.</li> <br />
                        <li>Reduced pollution from plastic: Biodegradable products can help reduce pollution from plastic and micro-plastic. Plastic pollution is a major problem worldwide, and it poses a threat to wildlife, ecosystems, and human health. Biodegradable products can be made from plant-based materials, such as cornstarch or sugarcane, which break down much more quickly and safely than traditional plastic.</li> <br />
                        <li>Conservation of natural resources: Biodegradable products are often made from renewable resources, such as plants or other organic matter, which can be grown and harvested sustainably. By using renewable resources, we can reduce our dependence on non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.</li> <br />
                        <li>Reduced emissions from transportation: Biodegradable products can be produced locally, which reduces the need for long-distance transportation and the associated emissions from shipping and trucking. By producing products locally, we can also support local businesses and reduce our carbon footprint.</li> <br />
                        <li>Promoting circular economy: Biodegradable products can also promote a circular economy, where products are designed to be reused, recycled, or composted at the end of their life cycle. By creating products that can be easily broken down and turned into new products, we can reduce waste and conserve resources.</li> <br />
                    </ul>
                    However, it's important to note that biodegradable products should not be seen as a complete solution to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Other measures, such as reducing energy consumption, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable practices, will also be necessary to achieve zero emissions.
                    <br /> <br />

                        <li>CCS (Carbon Capture Storage) - this is new research to capture and store Co2 in a solid form. There are different methods of CO2 capture and storage. In this process, CO2 is captured from industrial processes, such as power generation or manufacturing, and then stored in geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs or deep saline aquifers. The captured CO2 is typically stored in a compressed form, such as a supercritical fluid or dry ice (frozen CO2), rather than a crystal. These forms of CO2 storage help to prevent the release of CO2 into the atmosphere, which can help to mitigate climate change. CCS is still an emerging technology, which needs to be explored. However, it is an approach indicating that CO2 can be used in crystal form for specific products. CCS is including the following: mineral carbonation, 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC).</li> <br />
